# EduEdgeLMS
This project is a battery powered offline Linux based Learning Management System running on a Single Board Computer.
It delivers educational content in resource-constrained environments with no internet access. Hosted on a RaspberryPi, it creates a local Wi-FI hotspot for students to access lessons, quizzes and AI-driven personalized recommendations. Teachers can track student progress using a threaded SQLite database. This prototype was built for a hackathon.
